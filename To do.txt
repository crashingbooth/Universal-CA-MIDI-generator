define the midi window, create menu window to map cells to midi notes
- create a spinbox for autoselecting scale mappings (pentatonic, pelong, blues scale, whole tone, chromatic)
- but custom mapping should be possible too
- superclass (sublass for one state, muliple states)
- store state data in list of lists 
- gui has a method for drawing midi window onto display
- have a method to derive midi notes from list and note_seqs which can be rendered and exported as midi files
implement the export to midi
implement load and save states (need rules, isCyclic, width, length, first_line, !midi_mapping)
!!!!make a rule change schedule
bind arrow keys to move midi window

make five neighbor 2 state:
make n-state,
